Chromium B.S.U. Installation
----------------------------

Prerequisites
------------------

* Hardware accelerated OpenGL/Mesa environment (GLU required)

* SDL 1.1.6

Optional
--------
* Qt 2.2.x - for the chromium-setup utility. This utility lets you set
  all available options for Chromium, as well as browse for music files
  to add to your playList.

* SMPEG 0.4.2 - if you want to play MP3 files for background music

* Ogg/Vorbis - if you want to play OGG files for background music


Install data files
------------------
 Chromium B.S.U. will not work without the data files! Download and 
untar the data files and set environment variable CHROMIUM_DATA to 
point to that directory. 

Install Program files
---------------------
Run the 'configure' script, then type 'make'.

This will do the following:
 * configure and build OpenAL (in ./support/openal)
 * build glpng (in ./support/glpng)
 * build Chromium B.S.U. (in ./src)
 * build the Chromium B.S.U. setup utility (in ./src-setup)
